# Color

A simple webpage that displays colors based on the URL hash. Visit the page with a color value in the URL hash to display that color fullscreen.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage with a color value in the URL hash:

   - `/#ff3399`
   - `/#black`
   - `/#rgb(255,0,0)`
   - `/#hsl(200,100%,50%)`
   - `/#red;blue` (creates a linear gradient, top to bottom)
   - `/#ff0000;00ff00`

2. Double-click anywhere on the page to toggle fullscreen mode.
